### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me ðŸ˜„

Hi, I am Mohamed Elmessiry , a Full Stack Developer.

I am coming from a Finance background, new to the Tech industry, was fascinated by how the industry is evolving and growing, also how it's impacting every aspect of people's life's. This helped me make a decision regarding switching my career path to Web Development.

Personally, my passion comes from building fun and recreational apps 

When my journey started, I was limited to rendering some HTML elements on a page, but gone from a modest knowledge and have now been able to develop a full stack application.

I am dedicated to continuing to learn more and more about development, and I am excited about what I might build in the future.
